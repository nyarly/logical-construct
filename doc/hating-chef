Notes about tasks that Chef performs:

Install software (i.e. emerge <thing>)
Template configs (w/o regard to changes)
Edit files (not using patch)
Create files (a la GNU install), directories

Doesn't: manage archives (tarballs)



So, tasks that would be nice:
emerge (or apt-get or ...)
template files
apply patches
edit files? (still seems dicey)
create files/directories like GNU install does
unpack tarballs
manage symlinks
VCS checkouts

restart/start/enable services

run arbitrary shell commands (as little as possible)
  (Maybe just: template a file, run bash (file))


One thing Chef does that's useful is "notifies ... :delayed" - basically tasks that are only needed if this one is, but happen later
So: a Task type (mixin) that is #needed? based on a boolean - by default, not, but other tasks can say something like arm that:other:task ->
Rake::application[that:other:task].needed = true. Order of execution determined by dependency.

For package installs, consider /etc/portage/sets
