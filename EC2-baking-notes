Outstanding issues:
Where is the ephemeral storage mounted?  Probably needs to start as a config, maybe detect later

Data required:
Three categories: arbitrary (merely shared), task parameters, configuations

Task params:
Target machine
AMI name

Configurations:
Ephemeral storage mount
Private Key File
Certificate File
User ID
(bundle options, like includes)
Upload bucket
S3 access key
S3 secret key

Arbitrary:
Manifest path
Credential file paths

From the EC2 user guide:

[Provisioned]
Upload EC2 credentials to ephemeral storage (i.e. pk.pem + cert.pem)
[end provisioned]

[Local to baked machine - should be in target rakefile]
Write access needed on instance store (/mnt or /media/ephemeral0)
ec2-bundle-vol -k <private_keyfile> -c <certificate_file> -u <user_id> --include /opt/ec2-ami-tools/etc/ec2/amitools/cert-ec2.pem --include /etc/ssl/*
ec2-upload-bundle -b <bucket> -m <manifest_path> -a <access_key> -s <secret_key>
ec2-register <your-s3-bucket>/image.manifest.xml -n image_name
[end local]

So, if provision, needs to be something like:

GC:
rake bake[target,ami_name]
 -> ssh target rake bake (can return 13:"Target incapable", but if 0:...)
    Important here - on success, there needs to be a long-running process on target
    So: background self?  Fork new process and return "We're good to go?"
 -> build json configs
 -> ssh tunnel'd provision (target wants creds, configs)
 "Baking initialized"

(Pattern to be repeated in remote re-provisioning, too)

How to tell when done, where it's at?

Target rake task needs to log process, so reviewing/tailing logs lets us answer
the question "is it done yet." SNS/SES/other email when done?  Maybe something
simple like "mail" command - if set up, bully, otherwise, you're on your own
