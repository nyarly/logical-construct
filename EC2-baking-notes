ALWAYS check the ec2-api and ec2-ami tools versions

Outstanding issues:
Where is the ephemeral storage mounted?  Probably needs to start as a config, maybe detect later

Data required:
Three categories: arbitrary (merely shared), task parameters, configuations

Task params:
Target machine
AMI name

Configurations:
Ephemeral storage mount
Private Key File
Certificate File
User ID
(bundle options, like includes)
Upload bucket
S3 access key
S3 secret key

Arbitrary:
Manifest path
Credential file paths

From the EC2 user guide:

[Provisioned]
Upload EC2 credentials to ephemeral storage (i.e. pk.pem + cert.pem, AWS creds)
[end provisioned]

[Local to baked machine - should be in target rakefile]
Write access needed on instance store (/mnt or /media/ephemeral0)
ec2-bundle-vol -k <private_keyfile> -c <certificate_file> -u <user_id> --destination <somewhere ephemeral> --prefix <something unique - not 'image'> --arch x86_64 -i /etc/ec2/amitools/cert-ec2.pem -i $(ls /etc/ssl/certs/*.pem | tr \\n ,) --ec2cert /etc/ec2/amitools/cert-ec2.pem
ec2-upload-bundle -b <bucket> -m <manifest_path> -a <access_key> -s <secret_key> --retry
ec2-register <your-s3-bucket>/<prefix>.manifest.xml -n image_name --aws-access-key <access_key> --aws-secret-key <secret_key>
[end local]

(Commands that have worked:)
ec2-bundle-vol -k /mnt/pk.pem -c /mnt/cert.pem -u 180593873119 -d /mnt/bundling/ -r x86_64 -p nascent-042513 -i /etc/ec2/amitools/cert-ec2.pem -i $(ls /etc/ssl/certs/*.pem | tr \\n ,) --ec2cert /etc/ec2/amitools/cert-ec2.pem

ec2-upload-bundle -b sbmp-instances -m /mnt/bundling/nascent-042513.manifest.xml -a <access key> -s <secret key>

(For some reason this didn't:)
ec2-register sbmp-instances/nascent-042513.manifest.xml -n Nascent042513  #but web console worked fine


So, if provision, needs to be something like:

GC:
rake bake[target,ami_name]
 -> ssh target rake bake (can return 13:"Target incapable", but if 0:...)
    Important here - on success, there needs to be a long-running process on target
    So: background self?  Fork new process and return "We're good to go?"
 -> build json configs
 -> ssh tunnel'd provision (target wants creds, configs)
 "Baking initialized"

(Pattern to be repeated in remote re-provisioning, too)

How to tell when done, where it's at?

Target rake task needs to log process, so reviewing/tailing logs lets us answer
the question "is it done yet." SNS/SES/other email when done?  Maybe something
simple like "mail" command - if set up, bully, otherwise, you're on your own


Of note: there is a ec2-migrate-manifest command that has the basis of regenerating a manifest for a bundle (it's Ruby)
The right solution to multiple-client AMIs is LRD hosting the bundles on our S3, give permissions on them, and let clients register the AMIs that way. -- I think. Sorted this out with Locaverse, but the details are fuzzy atm.
