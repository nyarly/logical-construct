After consideration:

This is not a cloud server manager.  Those exist already.

This is a cloud deployment manager.  Write one description of how your cloud is built, deploy it whereever.

Puppet/chef handle like 90% of that, but before either can run, network has to
be configured, and persistent/extra volumes need to be mounted.

"Blessing" deploys is another thing - snapshot/repackage a currently running
instance so that we can shortcut deploy next time.

Things Ground control should be able to do:

* Survey Target hosts and make sure they have the configs they need.

* Given a target server with Ruby and SSH, set it up as a particular role.
* (I.e: SSH and deliver files, install gems, locked to GC version)
