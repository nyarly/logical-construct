SSH tunnelling for provision - ideally including a local HTTP proxy of all servers in need

Chef cookbook management?

Arrange deployment vs. application code... related at all?

AWS resolutions:
  from user_data (or other instance metadata)
  from S3?

Resolution chains - "look at instance metadata, then S3, then start Sinatra"

Resolution manifests - all Satisfiables "needed" unless they match the manifest (if the manifest task is present...)

Bless instances

"Promote" VBox instances to AWS

Need serious thought to re-design of Satisfiables/Resolver - from a Rake perspective, the Sats should depend on their Rez, but the Rez has to know about the Sats in order to resolve them.
