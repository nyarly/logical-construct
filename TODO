NEEDED:

* verify task that checks that all plan task deps exist
  - Ground Control can then set up an implement child and run verify before manifest
  - includes something like plan:version (e.g. chef:10.10.14) that exists just so that deps can be tracked and resolved
* File dep for BundleStandalone - Gemfile.lock -> Gemfile ?
* flight-deck needs to be broken into smaller tasklibs
* unique-task should be promoted to Mattock
* corundum QA on plans?
* exponential random backoff for finding an open port for the SSH forwarding

* Node's server still needs log files/post resolution state
  - so that ground control knows when provisioned server is done.
* Non-push resolutions. S3, for instance.
* AWS userdata manifests

* Random occassional SSH fails - hangs during background commands, but only sometimes

DONE:
* StandaloneBundler is the only place we need gem_scope
* flight-deck needs a switch to change its own targets
  - Ground control needs to make sure the server is running,
    deliver manifest, then start a full flight-deck
* flight-deck cleanup needs to be sequenced properly and actually run
* Ground control needs to add an rsync step to building plans - otherwise they're always archived (bundler unconditionally creates bundler/setup.rb)
* flight-deck needs to mirror some of its options to the child Implement - e.g. --tasks and --prereqs
