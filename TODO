SSH tunnelling for provision - ideally including a local HTTP proxy of all servers in need

Move /var/logical-construct to /var/run/lc or /opt/bin/lc or ...

Chef cookbook management?

Arrange deployment vs. application code... related at all?

AWS resolutions:
  from user_data (or other instance metadata)
  from S3?

Resolution chains - "look at instance metadata, then S3, then start Sinatra"

Resolution manifests - all Satisfiables "needed" unless they match the manifest (if the manifest task is present...)

Bless instances

"Promote" VBox instances to AWS

Bug: /etc/init.d/logical-construct is generated once and never rebuilt, so the LC_DP variable isn't set per rake setup.

Descriptions: need for setup, provision tasks - not sub tasks of setup

Something to handle private keys - an -i option to the SSH commands, basically,
but it needs to be per-project, and not in the Rakefile.  There's the
user-configuration, which'll make sense for a lot of things
(Time being: Judson is using Host *.compute-1.amazonaws.com in .ssh/config)

Consider S3 as a PORTAGE_BINHOST - should be possible to do installs on a machine, then mirror /usr/portage/packages to S3, especially if the metadata in S3 is such that we don't re-upload packages we pulled down to do the build.

Binhost needs to be related to arch, CHOST, CFLAGS, processor USE flags (MXX, SSE, ???)

Unpack needs (at least the option) to clobber target directory - otherwise "bad" files that are just deleted poison the directory.

Pack needs (something) to handle deleted files in the source directory - so file-style + archive index
